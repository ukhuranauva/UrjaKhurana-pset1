For the first assignment, we had to make an app where you can dress up Mr. Potato Head. 
I did this by using separate checkboxes for each part of Mr. Potato Head. By clicking an 
unchecked box of a part, that exact part is appears on Mr. Potato Head. That is way Potato Head can be
dressed up. 
Screenshots of the app can be found below: <br />
